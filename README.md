# p5.synth

A digital synthesizer project using the JavaScript library "p5.js".

The aim of this project is simply to improve my ability to create simple tools, objects, etc. in JavaScript. Therefore the synthesizer itself is not of great interest - but I hope that it will show some of the skills I wil learn.
